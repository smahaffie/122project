'''This file contains code to create the master school list that we use. 
It renames the school categories to be correct because CPS does not 
indicate which schools are magnet and selective enrollment and it merges 
multiple files together to create the data for the "main" table we use
in our SQL database. It also contains code to pad csvs that are missing schools 
with rows that contain just school IDS to ease the SQL querying process'''
