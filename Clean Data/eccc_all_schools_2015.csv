Early College Credit and Career Certification (ECCC) SY2015 Metric,,,"The Early College Credit and Career Certification (ECCC) metric used in SQRP measures the percent of students graduating in the most recent year who have earned at least one credit from an approved early college course, a 3+ on an AP exam, a 4+ on an IB exam, or an approved career certification. This metric measures the extent to which students are offered the opportunity to pursue early college credit and career certifications during their high school career.
